                            Epoxy resin is a very strong and stable material <b>when it is fully cured</b> - it maintains
                            its strength over a wide range of temperatures and atmospheric conditions. However, it is the total 
                            opposite scenario <b>while it is curing</b> - it is extremely sensitive to changes in temperature and 
                            humidity. Too warm and it will cure too fast and may crack, too cool and it may end up with a cloudy 
                            look. A difference of just one or two degrees celsius can have a significant impact on results. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That's why the first thing to consider in your preparation is your curing environment. It is essential 
                            to choose an environment where you can control the temperature on a continuous basis for several days. 
                            The key is to maintain the temperature at 21 degrees celsius, even overnight. If you are in a cooler climate, 
                            a small indoor room with a thermostat controlled heater will work well. If you are in a warmer area 
                            you may need a split system to cool the room to 21 during the day.   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The curing environment should be free of dust and contaminants. Give it a good dusting down and vacuum before you begin. 
                            Any candles, fireplaces, insense or automatic air fresheners should not be used in the area while resin is curing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prepare your mould to ensure that it is watertight with no leaks. You can use silicon from a caulking gun 
                            to seal any gaps. Ensure the mould is coated with a material that the epoxy resin doesn't bond to. There are 
                            lots of options for this but we prefer to keep it simple and coat the interior of the mould with 3M Packing 
                            Tape - it's cheap, available everywhere, and the cured epoxy comes right off it, no demoulding sprays required.

                            Mix 2 parts of Part A with 1 part of Part B in a clean mixing container. For example, for 15 L of 
                            resin, mix 10 L of Part A with 5 L of Part B. Ensure you only use the Part A and Part B of the same 
                            product - for example, you cannot use the Part A of Deep Pour with the Part B of Clarity Cast. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Any pigment powders, mica powders, dyes, inks or pastes can be added before mixing. 
                            Have fun experimenting with different colours and textures!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Mix well. We recommend stirring by hand with a wooden stirring stick for at least 4 minutes. Some people 
                            prefer using a drill with a mixing bit - this is certainly easier but we find this introduces more air bubbles 
                            into the mixture. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As soon as Part A and Part B are mixed, the chemical reaction has started. Pour the mixed resin immediately. 
                            Any unused resin cannot be reclaimed for later. 
                            Give the resin ample time to settle in to all the cracks and crevices of your work. Now is the time to watch out 
                            for any leaks in your mould. If you see any resin leaking out of the mould you can quickly patch it up with 
                            more silicon from a caulking gun. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Pay attention to the maximum depth of the pour and do not exceed the maximum pouring depth allowed by 
                            the resin you are using. For Deep Pour resin the maximum depth is 40mm and for Clarity Cast the maximum 
                            depth is 20mm. If you pour greater than this depth you risk an <b>uncontrolled exothermic reaction</b> - this is 
                            where the heat of the reaction between Part A and Part B increases out of control, leading to bubbles, 
                            cracks and even smoke.

                            The chemical reaction between Part A and Part B is what causes the resin to cure. The chemical reaction is known as 
                            an <b>exothermic</b> reaction - that is, it generates heat. 
                            You may notice you can feel the warmth if you hold your hand over the resin. Don't worry, this is normal!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bubbles may appear in the surface of the resin. The air may have been trapped in the resin while it was being 
                            mixed or poured, or air bubbles may have been trapped in the work piece you are casting, or air bubbles may be 
                            released from certain moulding materials such as silicon (a process known as "degassing"). In any case, we
                             recommend popping out any bubbles using a heat gun or butane torch. Be careful not to overheat the resin while
                              doing this, as this may accelerate curing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that bubbles may reappear over time. We recommend periodically checking the resin and 
                            popping out any new bubbles that have appeared. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The resin will gradually thicken over time, and at some point it will become hard. The exact point in time when it 
                            hardens is not easy to predict - it depends on how much resin is used, how deep it is poured, and the ambient 
                            temperature. Paradoxically, the deeper the pour is the faster it cures. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may be tempted to put your little artistic swirls in the resin as soon as its poured - you can, and it doesn't 
                            do any harm, but your work will be quickly undone as the resin settles. You will need to wait for the right time in 
                            the curing process to put your swirls in. Ideally the resin will be the consistency of thick honey - this is thin 
                            enough where its still possible to swirl the resin, without being too thin that the swirls will dissipate. Knowing 
                            when the time is right to do this is more art than science, and takes practice. Eventually you will get a feeling 
                            for the curing behaviour of your resin in your environment. In the mean time, we recommend checking your resin 
                            periodically to see where it's up to. Remember these two pointers to help guide you - the warmer the environment, 
                            the faster it cures; and the deeper the pour, the faster it cures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that once it is hardened it is still not fully cured yet - it may be hard but it can still bend and warp. 
                            Be careful not to remove it from the mould too early - if you do this it may slowly deform without the mould 
                            holding it in place. We recommend waiting 7 days before demoulding to be on the safe side.

                                Once fully cured, epoxy resin can be removed from the curing environment and can be taken out of the mould. 
                                It is now very resilient to a variety of environments, and is safe to touch and even eat food off of. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Epoxy can be machined in a similar way to hardwood. Fully cured epoxy is very hard - we treat it with our tools in the same way we would treat Jarrah or other 
                                timbers on the hardest end of the scale. It can be sawn, drilled, planed, routed in the same way as wood, with the same tools.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Because of the hardness of epoxy, a general rule of thumb when machining epoxy is "less is more". You'll get better results with 
                                shallow cuts repeated many times, for example, rather than a single deep cut. If you can control the speed of your tools, e.g., if 
                                your router has a speed setting, slow it down. Move your tools slowly in the epoxy. This is easier on your tools and reduces the 
                                risk of burning your piece.
                            </p>
                            <p class="subtitle">
                                Always wear a face mask when machining and sanding epoxy. We strongly recommend using a good dust collection system, either with a shop vac or a larger dust collector, so you avoid inhaling tiny epoxy particles.

                                Epoxy resin requires some slightly different finishing techniques than what would normally be used for timber. Unlike wood, epoxy 
                                is not porous (liquids do not penetrate it), and it is translucent (you can see through it). Therefore, epoxy responds well 
                                to fine sanding and polishing, and finishes that leave a fine translucent film. Don't use stains - if you want to colour your 
                                epoxy, do it with pigments in the mixing stage.

                                Finishing is a very personal thing - it depends greatly on personal taste. Because of this there are a practically infinite 
                                number of ways to finish epoxy resin, and just as many comment threads on the internet telling you different do's 
                                and don'ts of finishing epoxy. Therefore, we recommend you experiment with different types of finishes to see what works 
                                best for you. As always we love talking about these details with our clients, and <a href="javascript:FB.CustomerChat.show();">we'd

                                One finishing product that we particularly like is Odie's Oil - it's a mixture of naturally derived oils and waxes and is 100% food safe.
                                It's extremely easy to apply and looks great. The three key tips to remember when using Odie's Oil are stir it well, use it sparingly, buff on
                                and buff off. <a href="https://oakfieldclear.square.site/product/odies-oil-with-applicators/5?cs=true&cst=custom">Odie's Oil can be purchased online in our store here.</a>
