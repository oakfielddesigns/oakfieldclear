                            All Oakfield Clear resins exhibit a remarkably clear finish when cured. Clear or translucent pieces will shine like glass.
                            Pieces poured with mica, pigment powders or pastes will allow every little swirl and glitter in the resin to be highlighted. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reason for this is our special formulation that discourages crystals from forming in the part A of the resin at low temperatures.
                            Any crystals that do form are quickly dissolved when brought up to operating temperature. When the ideal temperature is maintained 
                            while the resin is curing, the end result boasts superb clarity that must be seen to be believed.

                            A classic problem with all epoxy resins is sensitivity to ultraviolet light. Epoxy resin is different to other compounds
                            like polyurethane in that epoxy resin absorbs UV light. The UV light reacts with the resin and very slowly damages the polymers
                            that make up the resin. This damage manifests itself by adding a yellow tint to the resin. This process is unavoidable and is a 
                            fundamental characteristic of the chemical compounds that make up epoxy resin - all epoxy resins will turn yellow over time. 
                            Additives can be added to epoxy by the manufacturer to delay the yellowing process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The UV stability characteristics of all Oakfield Clear resins is excellent. We have pieces over 12 months old that have been set 
                            up in a sunny indoor spot by a window - they are still the same colour today as they were when first poured. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With Oakfield Clear resins you can be confident that your pieces will retain their colour and resist the onset of yellowing for many
                            years to come.

                            Working with epoxy resin is hard. There are so many pitfalls, traps and gotchas to be aware of. Experienced epoxy users can still 
                            get caught out from time to time, and beginners can often find themselves going through many batches of resin on failed projects, 
                            learning things the hard way. This can be frustrating and expensive.
